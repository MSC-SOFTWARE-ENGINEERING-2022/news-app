# News App using React

This project is hosted in Netlify [https://jkuatmsc-group1-newsapp.netlify.app](https://jkuatmsc-group1-newsapp.netlify.app).

## Context

The task was an assignment for JKUAT Masters HCI (Human Computer Interaction) unit.\
It is about developing a user-interface for a news-app.

## Code

This is a React based app and data is from [NewYorkTimes API](https://developer.nytimes.com/apis) \
Due to restriction in API requests per minute and per day, the decision to download some json files was viable.\
Hence the current data is static but you can enable the live-data in /src/api files.

The API token is also for development purposes and will be deleted after assignment has been delivered and assessment completed.

## Local Deployment

Please remember to install all dependencies in the package.json file first before running the application.\
From the project folder, open the command-line execute the command:

### `npm i`

Then run:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
